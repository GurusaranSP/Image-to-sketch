# Image-to-sketch


The project is a web application developed using Python, OpenCV, and the Streamlit library. It converts uploaded images into either water color sketches or pencil sketches.

To run the code, you need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

To use the application, you need to upload an image (JPEG or PNG format) to the application. Then, you can choose the desired sketch effect from the drop-down menu. After clicking the "Download image" button, the converted image will be downloaded to your device.

Here is a description of the code structure:

Import the necessary libraries and frameworks
Define the functions for converting images to water color sketches and pencil sketches
Define the function for loading images
Create the main function of the application
Display basic headings and titles
Add an image file uploader
Add a select box to choose between water color and pencil sketch options
Display the original image and the converted image in separate columns
Add a download button to download the converted image
Run the main function if the script is executed directly
This code is well-structured and easy to understand. The functionalities are separated into different functions, making the code modular and maintainable. The use of Streamlit for creating the web application makes it user-friendly and visually appealing.
